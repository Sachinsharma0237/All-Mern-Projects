                which in-turn released hormones that influence the body’s natural healing, promotes physical and emotional wellbeing.

                In most cases common headache is caused by excessive stress, tension and 
                emotional changes. But migraine is a more complex situation where 
                the blood vessels of the brain enlarge to release chemicals from the 
                nerve fibers that cause inflammation and hence the severe pain.

                outbreaks and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic
